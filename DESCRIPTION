Description: The **equivtest** package implements the equivalence tests discussed in its companion paper, *Hartman, E., & Hidalgo, F. D. (2018). An Equivalence Approach to Balance and Placebo Tests. American Journal of Political Science, 62(4), 1000-1013*. For each equivalence test in this package, we have included excerpts of the relevant discussion from the companion paper with a worked through example from *Wellek, S. (2010). Testing statistical hypotheses of equivalence and noninferiority. Chapman and Hall/CRC*.
